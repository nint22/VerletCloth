VerletCloth
===========

A simple verlet-integration based 2D cloth simulation. This code is written in standard
Javascript and uses the [Three.js](http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/) library for
rendering through WebGL / Canvas through any modern browser. This was done as a quick
debugging project as I couldn't get an equivalent high-performance C++ implementation
to work.
